	* Menu background
4. Create star arrays and hints, adding misleading stars
	* Based off of starry backgrounds, highlight some stars by making them bigger.
	* Add some level-specific hints for our figureheads to say
5. Write code for giving hints
	* Make figureheads appear and talk if player does not get a correct line in X number of seconds
6. Write code for level selection and progression
	* Add a menu for easy level selection.
7. Alpha test gameplay as a group
